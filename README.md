# tablegrid
TableGrid class for Lazarus/Delphi
TTableGrid - This class enhances the TStringGrid component, setting it up
             to behave as a Data Table, offering features like
             column swaping, sorting, odd and even colors, exclusive
             header font, indicator arrow, and much more.
             This is a class, not a component. You need to have
             a TStringGrid component to pass as a parameter when creating
             the TTableGrid instance.
